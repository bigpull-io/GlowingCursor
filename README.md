# Glowing Cursor

Never lose your cursor again during intense boss fights! This simple addon that adds a glowing visual effect to your mouse cursor.

Originally created as a WeakAura, this addon was beloved by many players who enjoyed having a colorful glow follow their cursor around the screen. With the release of Midnight, WeakAuras are no longer available, so I created this lightweight standalone addon as an alternative solution.

## Features

- Visual glow effect that follows your cursor in real-time
- Two color options: Blue and Yellow
- Adjustable size and offset positioning
- Minimal resource usage

## Configuration

Access settings via Esc → Options → AddOns → Glowing Cursor
